The home page refresh is part of a longer-term cmu.edu Web redesign project that will include a discovery process and an overhaul of the site architecture. In addition to a new look that will feature larger images and a more streamlined design, the refresh includes changes in the editorial content on the page. A dominant story will be featured twice a week and will primarily focus on stories that promote CMU s international presence and strategic topic areas, such as BrainHub , the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation , the Simon Initiative , the Tepper Quad and Presidential Scholarships and Fellowships . Three news stories on the page will change often. Shortly following the home page refresh, the CMU news website will be revised, becoming the main source of news for the university community and external visitors. The CMU home page was most recently designed in 2007, and refreshed in 2009. Statistics reveal that the majority of visitors to the site are looking for admission information. ### Faculty Staff News 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213 (412) 268-1613 Carnegie Mellon Home
