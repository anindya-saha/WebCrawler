Bollinger â€œJudges and lawyers around the world routinely display great courage by standing firm in their commitment to free expression and the open sharing of information, often under harsh attacks against their independence,â€? said Bollinger.Â â€œThese individuals are creating a new set of global legal standards essential for safeguarding speech and the press in our modern society.Â  The fact that they do so without fanfare, using the unremarkable tools of legal opinions and briefs, makes their work no less deserving of our admiration and our recognition.â€? â€œIn many countries, judicial institutions fail to uphold freedom of the press, issue rulings that undermine the robust flow of information and impose harsh sentences on those whose only â€˜crimeâ€™ was to exercise their right to freedom of expression,â€? said Columbia Global FoE DirectorÂ  Dr. AgnÃ¨s Callamard. â€œThe justice sector ought to be a guarantor of the right to freedom of expression and a fundamental recourse against arbitrary abuse of power and censorship. This is what we want to affirm and honor.â€?
