Columbia Community Service is one of the oldest organizations on campus. Our yearly campaign is a means for faculty, staff and retirees of Barnard College, Columbia University and Teachers College to support soup kitchens, after-school programs, and more critical services, through direct financial contributions. With the University covering all administrative expenses, 100% of the contributions go directly to services. The grants awarded by CCS are for direct services only, and not for salaries.
