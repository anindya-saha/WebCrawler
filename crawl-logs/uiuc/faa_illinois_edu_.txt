Robert Ivy, the chief executive officer of the American Institute of Architects, calls the scholars in this group of 11 architecture and public health schools â€œsome of the nationâ€™s leading thinkers about the growing connection between design and public health.â€? Illinois researchers will examine physiological responses to determine how elements of homes and neighborhoods can return people to a healthy state after being in stressful situations. Their goal is to develop design tools that will assist in devising houses and communities that will improve well-being. The School of Architecture team and other consortium members will collaborate over a three-year period on diverse topics connecting design with health.
