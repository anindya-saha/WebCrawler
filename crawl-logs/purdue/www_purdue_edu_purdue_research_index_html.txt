Don t bet on finding a big crater left behind from an asteroid strike on Earth. It is likely that most of the large impact craters on Earth have already been discovered and that others have been erased, according to a new calculation by a pair of Purdue University graduate students. "Over the past 3.5 billion years it is thought that more than 80 asteroids similar in size to, or larger than, the one that killed the dinosaurs have struck the Earth," says graduate student Timothy Bowling. The Purdue model is the first to quantify how many craters have likely been erased through geologic processes and other factors. It shows that most of the craters created by the strikes have been discovered.
