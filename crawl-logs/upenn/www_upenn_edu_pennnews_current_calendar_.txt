Info: www.icaphila.org.Â  DEAR NEMESIS The Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) presents â€œDear Nemesis, Nicole Eisenman 1993â€“2013â€?â€”the most expansive mid-career survey of this major American artist to date. Featuring more than 120 paintings, drawings, prints, and sculptures, â€œDear Nemesisâ€? aims to represent Eisenmanâ€™s sprawling 20-year output.Â  A painter consistently drawn to figures and faces, Eisenmanâ€™s canvases overflow with pathos, humor, tenderness, and violence. An early focus on drawing, evident in murals and installations, evolved into large, narrative paintings clustered with bodies and heads. Often abstracted into planes of color, Eisenmanâ€™s heads laugh, cry, kiss, and bend into the glow of cell phones. Eisenmanâ€™s queer and feminist work often repositions historical works of art. Her work frequently reflects Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, and Ã‰douard Manetâ€™s greatest hits recast as bitingly political and deeply intimate subjects, reanimating the radicalism of these classic works. Accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue, the exhibition was organized for the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis by curator Kelly Shindler, and by Assistant Curator Kate Kraczon for the ICA.Â  The exhibition runs at the ICA, 118 S. 36th St. Admission is free, and hours run Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., Thursday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.Â  For more information, visit www.icaphila.org or call 215-898-7108.

He was probably one of the most influential losers in American history.â€? Presidential historian Alvin S. Felzenberg, a lecturer at the Annenberg School for Communication, on the reasons why politicians endure the rigors of running for president. Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater ran in 1964 and was trounced by President Lyndon Johnson. ( USA Today , Nov. 27, 2014) Penn Current Editorial Staff Manager of Internal Communications Heather A.
