The Funding Landscape at UW-Madison There are often resources available to help you fund your education. At UW-Madison, you may be offered graduate assistantships (such as Teaching, Project, or Research Assistantships), fellowships, or traineeships that will help defray some or all of your expenses. Assistantships or fellowships are especially valuable, as they may provide tuition remission in addition to a monthly stipend and health insurance. Assistantships are offered by programs only, not through the Graduate School.   You can learn about the funding landscape in your intended program(s) by visiting the academic program profile. This site will tell you the percent of students in the program are supported and the types of support they receive. Stay Informed about Funding Opportunities Eligibility for all graduate assistantships and most fellowships is determined at the program or departmental level. During the application process, stay in touch with your program’s graduate program coordinator to learn about particular funding opportunities for which you may be eligible. Check the program’s website to find contact information.  If you want to be considered for fellowships, you must submit your Graduate School application by your program’s fellowship deadline date.
