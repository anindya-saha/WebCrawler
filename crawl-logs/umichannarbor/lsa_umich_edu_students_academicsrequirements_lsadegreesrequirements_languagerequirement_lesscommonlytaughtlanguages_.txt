Today, the Hebrew program at the University of Michigan is one of the largest and strongest programs in the country. People study Hebrew for different reasons. For some, it is the desire to be able to read the Hebrew Bible in the original language; for others, who are interested in Israel and wish to understand its people, culture and politics, Hebrew is necessary. Some people wish to use Hebrew as a means of communication. For others, the goal is the ability to read Hebrew literature, scholarship, newspapers or electronic media. No matter what your goal is, we offer a variety of courses and learning opportunities. The modern Hebrew program (Hebrew and Jewish Cultural Studies) educates students in modern Hebrew language and literature. Sections exist for heritage learners as well as beginners. Classical Hebrew In the Ancient Civilizations and Biblical Studies program, instruction is given in Classical Hebrew as well as the literature, history, and culture of Ancient Israel and its neighbors. Developing competence in Classical Hebrew facilitates access to the ancient texts of Early Israel and ancient Judaism, that is, to the manuscript evidence that constitutes what we identify today as the Hebrew Bible and the so-called Jewish Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha and thereby to various aspects of the corresponding social worlds of ancient Israel and Second Temple Judaism. Not only that, but owing to its close linguistic affinities to such contemporary languages as ancient Aramaic and Phoenician, it also enhances the accelerated learning of those languages and access to the corresponding ancient writings and social worlds of the Arameans and Phoenicians.

It is the national language of the Republic of Turkey, a key player in the complex politics of the Middle East, and one of the largest and most dynamic economies of the area, as a major trading partner of the European Union on one side and the countries of the Middle East on the other. Turkish was also the administrative language of the predecessor of Turkey, the Ottoman Empire, which for more than four centuries was the predominant power in the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, at the peak of its power extending from Sudan to Hungary, and from Algeria to Yemen and the Caucasus. Both the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey have produced a rich and variegated culture, from folk and elite tradition to a literature of breathtaking modernity. As a part of the Turkic language family, Turkish is categorized as an agglutinative language, meaning that its structure is rich, highly abstract, and of fascinating, almost mathematical regularity. Written in Latin characters since 1928, its writing system matches its logical structure. Turkish is also the most convenient stepping stone on the way to older forms of the language, such as Ottoman Turkish, the literary language of the Ottoman Empire written in Arabic letters, and other modern Turkic languages, most of which are spoken in Central Asia, such as Uzbek, Kazakh, Kirghiz, or Uyghur.
