Mirlyn: Search Home --> --> Search History Weâ€™re still working on Search History. We hope to have it available soon. Once itâ€™s here, it will provide a list of your recent searches and allow you to revisit them within a browser session. Search Tips Phrase Searching Use quotes to search an exact phrase: e.g. "occult fiction" Boolean Searching Use AND, OR, and NOT between words to combine them with Boolean logic: e.g. (heart OR cardiac) AND surgery NOT procedures will find items about heart surgery or cardiac surgery but not about surgery procedures. Boolean terms must be in uppercase Plus (+) and Minus (-) Operators Use '+' (plus) immediately before a word to make that word required -- items must contain that word in order to match your search. Use '-' (minus) immediately before a word to exclude that word -- items must not contain that word in order to match your search. +cat -dog would match all items that contain the word cat but not the word dog.
