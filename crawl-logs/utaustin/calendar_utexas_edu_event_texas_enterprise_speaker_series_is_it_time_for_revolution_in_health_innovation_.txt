It s time to focus on creating and nurturing a new kind of healthcare ecosystem that encourages grassroots input, quickly identifies low-hanging fruit, convenes the right partners to maximize effectiveness, and is nimble enough to experiment and scale rapidly. In areas such as medical education, population health, informatics and digital health, there s an incredible opportunity to rethink old models and support creative collaborations that become engines of change all with a focus on improving health.
