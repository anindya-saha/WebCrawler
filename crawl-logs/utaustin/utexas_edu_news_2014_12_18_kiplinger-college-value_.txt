UT Austin Ranks 14th in Kiplingerâ€™s List of 100 Best-Value Public Colleges Dec. 18, 2014 AUSTIN, Texas â€” The University of Texas at Austin has risen to 14th place in Kiplingerâ€™s Personal Financeâ€™s list of 100 best values in public colleges for 2015. In Kiplingerâ€™s 2014 report, The University of Texas at Austin was ranked 21st. The rankings cite four-year public schools that combine outstanding education with economic value. â€œThere is no better measure of a public university than the value it provides to its students and the general public. Kiplingerâ€™s rankings recognize UT Austinâ€™s continued success in providing an affordable, world-class education to students from around Texas and the world,â€? said UT Austin president Bill Powers. The annual rankings will appear in Kiplingerâ€™s February 2015 issue, which goes on newsstands Dec. 31. Kiplingerâ€™s reviews such measures as admission rates, the percentage of students who return for sophomore year, the student-faculty ratio and the four-year graduation rate. The rankings also examine tuition and fees, financial aid offerings and average student debt at graduation. â€œUnlike other college rankings, ours are based entirely on measurable criteria. Neither our opinion nor anyone else's affects the calculation,â€? said Jane Bennett Clark, senior editor of Kiplingerâ€™s Personal Finance. This is the latest in a series of rankings that recognize UT Austin as one of the best universities in the nation and world. Earlier this year, U.S. News World Report ranked the university 30th in the world in its first-ever Global University Rankings. The ranking placed UT Austin as 23rd among U.S. universities and 10th among public universities in the U.S. Also this year, the Center for World University Rankings ranked UT Austin 29th, and the Times Higher Education ranked the university 28th in the world.
