Hundreds of actors, dancers, writers and musicians pursue their passion hereâ€”on the stage and in the classroom. Come share in our excitement for bringing creativity and culture to Chapel Hill. Â  Performing Arts On any given night at UNC, a step show might shake the Student Union stage, while the notes of a prominent soprano touch the ceiling of Memorial Hall. Here, the performing arts are showcased and nurtured. Vocalists and violinists, steppers and ballerinas, leading ladies and directors â€“ they can all be seen, heard, and discovered at UNC. Visual Arts Here, our walls do talk. They hold the glow of student-produced documentaries, the photography of celebrated shutterbugs, the rare paintings and sketches you thought youâ€™d never get the chance to see, and the work of those weâ€™ll talk about in years to come. But thatâ€™s not all â€“ sculptures dotting the campus walkways and art installations in some of the least likely places make Carolina a great place to lay your eyes on something new.
