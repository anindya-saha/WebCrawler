Spiritual Formation Spiritual Formation Program The curriculum of Duke Divinity School seeks to cultivate a life of worship, study and service. Integral to this commitment is spiritual formation . First-year students pursuing a master of divinity or master of theological studies are assigned to small, intentionally diverse groups that gather weekly to pray, share concerns and explore practices of spiritual discipline. Worship Life Students, faculty and staff share leadership for an array of worship services that embrace the rich musical and artistic traditions of the church: services of preaching, Holy Communion, morning prayer, healing, reconciliation, testimony and revival. Scheduling worship at the center of the academic day encourages students, faculty, and staff to continue in fellowship over lunch. Celebrate Fellowship â€œHere at Duke Divinity School, we are committed to the very ancient idea that in order to be a person for others, you have to be with others,â€? says Willie J. Jennings, Ph.D.â€™93, assistant research professor of theology and black church studies. â€œYou have to be there in the classroom, in the hallway, at worship, and at meals. All that is fundamental to being a servant leader.â€? Learn more about student life Â» Field Education Whether you serve in a church, hospital, prison, campus ministry, homeless shelter or one of many other settings, contextual learning is an integral part of your Duke Divinity School preparation for ministry. Two units of field education are required for the M.Div. degree. One will be in the context of a local church, but the other may be completed in an extension or specialized ministry.
