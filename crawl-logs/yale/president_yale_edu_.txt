Over the years, I have met many people in our laboratories, libraries, and classrooms, who remain close colleagues and lifelong friends. Yale is more than just a place where one studies and works—it is a place that brings people together as a community and binds them in the shared pursuit of knowledge. Since my appointment as president, I have had the pleasure of listening to thoughtful advice about how we can make Yale an even more inspiring institution.
