Please remember that our aid program is entirely need based and Princeton does not award merit scholarships. How it Works After you answer the basic questions describing your family circumstances, the Estimator will provide information about both the amount your family would be expected to contribute toward your college costs as well as the aid you could receive from Princeton. The Estimator uses Princeton's own formula when determining the family contribution and applies our specific packaging policies (such as no required student loan) to arrive at the projected award. The current Estimator shows awards for the 2014-15 academic year. However, even if your first year of college is further in the future, it can provide a starting point for understanding how Princeton’s aid program applies to your family. Net Price Calculator After you review the results of Princeton's Aid Estimator, you can see how financial aid and your family's contribution can be used to pay Princeton's charges. The Net Price Calculator will help you get an idea of your family's "bottom line" obligations. Limitations The Estimator is designed for families living in the U.S. and Canada. It will not provide accurate results for families residing outside of North America. Important Caveats The result you receive is not a commitment of an aid award. While this Estimator reflects Princeton's own aid practices (which may differ from other colleges) actual awards for admitted students are determined individually by the aid office. Professional judgment made on a case-by-case basis may result in variations from the standard calculations. Federal student aid eligibility is determined through a separate government methodology. Outside scholarships and employee tuition benefits will be considered part of the aid award. The term-time job and summer savings expectations are reduced first before replacing grant aid. The accuracy of the information you provide on the worksheet affects the accuracy of your estimated results. Your information will not be transmitted to Princeton or stored on this webpage. You should print a copy before you exit the Estimator if you want to retain the results. Affordability FAQs   Video: Princeton IS affordable.  Think you would need aid to help pay Princeton's costs?
