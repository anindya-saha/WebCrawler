Princeton Social Media Princeton Social Media A blog from the social media team in Princeton University's Office of Communications. The Center for African American Studies: Social media after Ferguson Allison Bland is a media specialist at Princeton s Center for African American Studies . The morning after a grand jury failed to indict Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown, I walked upstairs and quietly sat in on Professor Imani Perryâ€™s course, Diversity in Black America. At my desk, Iâ€™d been watching a chorus of social media responses ring in on Ferguson, but I didnâ€™t yet have the words myself. Like many, the previous night I followed the announcement of the grand jury decision on Twitter. I registered my reaction in tweets. I felt some community with my timeline, reading the responses from the interesting patchwork of people Iâ€™ve chosen to follow, a list built over several years. Thereâ€™s no doubt Twitter is the perfect platform for building a personal dashboard of interesting individuals and groups. As an ordinary, concerned young adult, it felt appropriate to grapple with questions, emotions, and uncertainty. But what is the role of the Princeton University Twitter account that I manage â€” the account of the Center for African American Studies? This is a field that is not driven by emotions, it is a field that answers questions, and can set a course.Â  I knew an important and deliberate potential for meaningful engagement existed here; an opportunity to act as a connecter within the Princeton University community, and the chance to give a glimpse into the hardworking intellectual home of faculty and students. I wanted to approach the recent events in Ferguson and around the country with our @PrincetonCAAS Twitter account grounded in the voice, expectations, and bounds of African American studies, and in particular, African American studies at Princeton. A report by former Princeton President Shirley Tilghman describes the field in this way : â€œAfrican American Studies deals directly with one of the most durable and significant social problems faced by the American polityâ€”and, indeed, insofar as it speaks to issues of racial identity and justice more generally, the world.â€? That morning, students in the Diversity in Black America class explored topics around Michael Brownâ€™s identity, issues of justice in America, and the histories of social movements. Professor Perry shared insight from an innovative manuscript she was currently reviewing, offered her analysis as a legal scholar, and framed and reframed the morningâ€™s conversations. It became clear that the role of @PrincetonCAAS on a day like this should not be to encapsulate an institutional point-of-view, but to draw people into each other - to be a space for the spectrum of conversation occurring in the CAAS community. So I wanted to use the Twitter account to reveal our community - as a sort of map, both for participants and for observers, plotting the students, faculty and others coming together in this moment. A person looking at the @PrincetonCAAS timeline could then view this patchwork of perspectives for their own considerations. Because our Center recently added several new professors, this moment also helped spread the word about new voices at our table who are working to contextualize the moment, but are not yet fully known to the Princeton community. The events in Ferguson helped strengthen our collective CAAS voice, one that would grow even more critical in the coming weeks, as more and more disturbing cases of racialized violence came to light. Since late November, CAAS has seen close to 50,000 views of our posts, a steady stream of new followers, and Iâ€™ve noticed an increase in press inquiries for our faculty. CAAS is a unique academic space in that it is so digital. Of our 15 core faculty, 8 maintain a very active presence on Twitter, and without a doubt, you should follow them. ( @imaniperry , @esglaude , @wardellfranklin , @ruha9 , @chikaokekeagulu , @kinohin , @keeangayamahtta , @wendylbelcher . We have affiliated faculty and fellows on Twitter too, see: @SoulistaPHD , @JLWeisenfeld ) When I retweet them on the @PrincetonCAASâ€‹ timeline, I am inviting followers to look to these timelines for more information, exploration, and context. My retweets often point to toward provocative or interesting ideas, and suggest to followers to engage with this faculty member to continue the conversation. Although @PrincetonCAAS dabbles in some knowledge-sharing tweet-up sessions on occasion, faculty members are best equipped to disperse 140 character summaries of their research and thinking. These are the topics they write and consider daily - so a thorough reading of the social media of the Center for African American Studies must include particular facultyâ€™s spaces and accounts. A check into faculty @replies, reveals a great deal of engagement per tweet. In fact, regularly dissenting opinions, and not infrequently, hate speech, can be witnessed on faculty pages. It is this last issue that poses the biggest setback for me in terms of revealing our full active online community, which includes a great many graduate and undergraduate students. These students have not yet chosen a career in the academic field of African American studies (whose scholars are now accustomed to such battles) and they have not selected the career of a social media professional, either. CAAS has watched and supported our undergraduate students in particular, whoâ€™ve taken up the task of becoming student-activists and student-organizers, on-campus, in New York City, and in their home communities, including the greater St. Louis, Missouri area. They take up a vital part of social change that is approached with particular aplomb by young people. These bright students are our critical mass. Princeton undergraduate students have used tools including walkouts, writing op-eds and open letters, huddling in the streets in sit-ins and die-ins, engaging more actively in classes, and meeting with Princeton administration to bring attention to issues of racialized state violence, and the ensuing racial issues on campus their activism has revealed. Most of the undergraduates organizing consider Twitter to be an important tool in their kit. I am happy to engage with them on social media on behalf of @PrincetonCAAS in order to amplify their ideas and to bring attention to the types of advocacy that builds African American studies and critical engagement around race. Students are very savvy about engaging with CAAS online. Sometimes theyâ€™ll include the @PrincetonCAAS account as well as a faculty memberâ€™s account in a tweet, or choose a more discrete method that doesnâ€™t necessarily trigger a notification on my Tweetdeck. Itâ€™s also important to realize that when students mention @PrincetonCAAS, they are not necessarily referring to an experience that happened on social media, but are seeking to relay their feelings towards the Center for African American Studies as a whole. It is my duty to share those sentiments with the wider CAAS community, and hopefully the person who may have triggered that expression. Students have told me in recent weeks that theyâ€™ve seen their social media accounts increase in visibility. In some cases their follower numbers have increased substantially. In other cases, theyâ€™ve made public previously locked accounts so that they may be retweeted. In all cases, their timelines are now open for scrutiny by a much wider public. Theyâ€™ve made the decision to become public figures willingly. However, deciding whether or not to interact with student accounts is still something that should be considered carefully. A few things to think about: First, does this student seem like they welcome a follow, or perhaps should I appreciate their posts from time to time, when they specifically chose to engage me? Even if this student is a public tweeter, does this particular tweet seem to be one they aimed to have launched and retweeted widely? There are ways to write coded, private tweets even on public social media platforms. If I retweet a provocative statement by a student, what are some of the potential effects for this student? Might they potentially face hateful remarks by Twitter trolls, or becoming flagged by administrators? In some instances, Iâ€™ve decided I can show my support for a studentâ€™s statement by favoriting a tweet, replying to them directly, or even sending an email or giving a call. Still, the patchwork of CAAS voices would not have been nearly as strong and bold in the past several weeks without the added might of our students. For example, students created their own account just for activism. @Ferguson_PU is comprised of a collection of student-activists gathered under the one assumed identity. The online environment is not perfect, but every day people are finding innovative ways to humanize this medium, encourage nuanced and respectful discourse, build awareness, and create alliances across vast differences. The @PrincetonCAAS account hopes to continue to facilitate these important interactions between faculty, students, and other members of our online community. - Allison Bland ( @PrincetonCAAS ) 3 notes 1 week ago Princeton PrincetonSM Princeton University PrincetonU Social Media hesm higher ed Ferguson African American studies Twitter strategy students CAAS Promoted: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Boost (Part I) Justin Goldberg is the web and multimedia strategist in Princeton s Lewis Center for the Arts .Â  Reports of Facebookâ€™s demise are greatly exaggerated. The supposed â€œcrashâ€? in teen engagement, documented in Pew research studies several years ago, has leveled off according to more recent investigations . Like our audience, we are gradually allocating a greater share of our attention (the most precious resource of all) to other social media platforms. But Facebook still plays a pivotal role in the Lewis Centerâ€™s online communications, and itâ€™s still the place where many of our readersâ€”students, alumni, local arts audiences, and the mediaâ€”are most likely to learn about events and news about the arts at Princeton.Â  Itâ€™s a venue where we can share richer content (sorry Twitter), reach more varied audiences (sorry Snapchat), and drive viewers to our website (sorry Instagram), which is crucial when sharing a call to action like a link for performance tickets. But when we publish a status update, who sees it? Research conducted by Social@Ogilvy shows that over the past several years, organizations and companies with Facebook pages have seen their organic reach plummet to about 6% (some as low as 2%). In other words, of the 2,000+ people who have â€œLikedâ€? the Lewis Center on Facebook, only 150 or so will typically see our posts appear in their news feed.Â  Why did readers â€œlikeâ€? our page so that Facebook could not show them the content we share? Why did we invest so much care in building a robust page presence, only to see our contentâ€™s visibility slide toward zero? Facebook is still figuring out the answers to these questions and so are we, its users, as shareholders and would-be competitors exert influence on the all-important algorithm. Too little advertising means no revenue, no sustainability; too much will erode trust and with it, engagement. Hanging in the balance is whether Facebook still feels like a kind of commons or becomes an echo chamber for advertising. We donâ€™t want to put a thumb on that scale, we want to thumb our noses at the idea of paying for something that promised it would always be free !Â  But our most engaging posts, shared and â€œlikedâ€? at much higher-than-average rates, still only have an organic reach of 20 â€“ 30%. What about the rest of our potential audience, those who opted in to see our updates in their news feed? At first it felt like an admission of defeat to boost the occasional post, even for a modest $5 or $10. But with tentative experiments and plenty of feedback, weâ€™ve seen that a boost here and there can have a measurable impact and ensure that we reach our readers where and when they want to hear from us. Posts can be promoted so that they are seen by a greater percentage of those who already like our page and their friends, or a specific demographic group such as people over 40 within a 10-mile radius of Princeton who are interested in modern dance. The former approach often creates a positive feedback loop within our existing network (more likes/shares = more visibility), while the latter has helped garner new readers and draw audiences, particularly for events with niche appeal. Our boosted posts are not turning people offâ€”there are almost no negative reactions (users hiding posts, reporting them as spam, or un-liking our page). Along with Facebookâ€™s â€œInsights,â€? anecdotal feedback from students and faculty helps us to ensure that we are using this tool responsibly and staying relevant to our audience. We donâ€™t approach advertising on Facebook as a means to intrude on and monopolize our readersâ€™ limited attention. Weâ€™re careful to keep a very light touch, and are always gathering input to do a better job. Any tips for us? â€¦ So what kind of Facebook post warrants a boost? What are the options and settings? How do we gather feedback and interpret the results? We ll answer these questions and more in Part II.

But when we do, we appreciate our readers letting us know." That s what I have posted on social media when someone has kindly pointed out that a Princeton post is missing a comma or has misspelled "physics." It happens. It s not fun. We try hard not to make mistakes, and no doubt you re anti-typo, too. So I want to share with you a short list of things I do to keep Princeton s social media posts relatively error-free. And, yikes, just typing that last sentence feels like an invitation to a huge gaffe; check our feeds later to see if I ve remembered the double r in squirrel. Here s the list: I often write posts in a word doc, then paste them into the app. Spellcheck is an excellent first line of defense. I bump up the font 12 pt. is pretty easy on the eyes. I ask fellow grammar nerds in my office for their opinions not only on spelling, but also about usage and syntax. We have some pretty wild conversations. I let the subjects of of photo captions type their names directly into my phone. I sweat the proofreading. I once worked with a very smart copy chief who approached her job with the force of a professional athlete. ( Sometimes the other team wins, was her take on typos.) And if all else fails, there s always Frustrated Tiger . That s the name of a short movie Ryan and I made a few weeks ago for just such emergencies. Watch it and see for yourself. In truth, we haven t even begun to explore all the uses for this piece of video - which is both a good and a sort of scary thing. And just for fun (told you we were nerdy with the grammar stuff) there s a mistake in this post. Did you spot it?Â  - Jill Feldman ( @jill_feldman ) 11 notes 1 month ago Princeton PrincetonU PrincetonSM Social Media Higher Ed hesm spelling Twitter Typos Grammar A day in the life of @JamieSaxonArts Jamie Saxon is the humanities writer in the Office of Communications I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to get Kate Middleton into a tweet on my Twitter handle @JamieSaxonArts , which I started two years ago as the University s virtual arts and culture desk. Every tweet, naturally, has to have a Princeton connection, which clearly is very easy to do 99 percent of the time. But I also adore Kate Middleton, so while I follow @WhatKateWore and wait for her to wear something orange or suddenly announce that she hopes George will apply to Princeton, I keep busy creating tweets that share arts news about Princeton, both on campus and around the world. I certainly squeeze in a celebrity mention when I can, which is pretty easy when you work at Princeton. Like this tweet about the totally fabulous It Guy, actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who stars in the film The Imitation Game about Alan Turing, opening Nov. 21. Since I follow @VanityFair (my source for all things Hollywood), I was able to create the tweet below by playing up Alan Turing s Princeton connection. I also included a link to the VF blog about the film and Benedict s Twitter handle, so he can direct-tweet me back and invite me to the New York premiere. #stillwaiting People like to feel part of a community so I started a number of themed tweets: Behold my Objets d Orange series â€” my Princeton-y twist on that snooty thing artsy people say when they re at a cocktail party: Ooh, Felicia, I adore all your your objets d art â€” I couldn t help but peek at your Sotheby s catalog in the loo, let s go to the Mayan figurines auction next Tuesday after our doubles game. If you snap a photo of something beautiful or cool that s orange, email it to me! It doesn t have to be from campus. I posted a photo of an orange Mini Cooper once. I also started a series with the hashtag #tipstosupportcreativity, where I curate quotes and ideas from around the Twitterverse or in the media that I find inspiring. Here s one I found in @FastCompany magazine. I also like to let my followers know about Princeton students and faculty who are bringing the joy of Princeton to other cities and countries. For those, I start the tweet with #PrincetonU in [fill in the blank city or country]. Here s one about the swell TigerTones in Beijing, those lucky rascals. Just last Friday I started a new thing: Weekend Arts Warrior. Iâ€™m unstoppable! I get ideas for tweets from lots of different sources: people and arts groups I follow on Twitter, the media, or you know, just driving in my car. I always listen to classical music in my car, and the other day on the way to work, the WWFM guy announced a rebroadcast of a Princeton Glee Club concert at 7 p.m. that evening. When I got to the office I tweeted it with the link to the station and the Glee Club s Twitter handle.Â Another day, I tuned in to the Thursday morning program of Teri Noel Towe (a 1970 alumnus) on Princeton s WPRB, and he was interviewing Gabriel Crouch, director of choral music. So I pulled over and tweeted from my phone Listen NOW . I try to include a photo in my tweet if one s available, but if not, I try to include the Twitter handle of anyone or anything mentioned in the tweet (yes, even if it s @Harvard). That way, those peeps will get a message saying they were mentioned in my tweet, and hopefully, they ll retweet it, immediately increasing exposure for my Twitter handle. I also LOVE hashtags. To me, hashtags are the virtual equivalent of when you and your best friend needed only to make eye contact in high school and you just knew what the other was thinking. #girlsdoyouhavesomethingtoshare But, embrace the cardinal rule: No more than four Twitter handle, hashtags and/or links in one tweet. Otherwise, your followers will totally wave the waiter over and say Check, please because your tweets look like computer code on the Starship Enterprise. Honestly, there is so much going on in the arts at Princeton that it is easy-peasy (did I just write that?) to populate my Twitter account. I m still looking for a way to get Kate Middleton into a tweet, but I am fully occupied with creating tweets about everything from the Bent Spoon s malted cone flavor they concocted in honor of a concert series named after Princeton composer Edward T. Cone to Princeton University Ballet s fall photo shoot. (You will see in the tweet below I am shameless.) -Jamie Saxon ( @JamieSaxonArts )Â  3 notes 1 month ago Twitter Arts Arts at Princeton social media hesm Higher Ed kate middleton benedict cumberbatch alan turing vanity fair fast company dance hashtags PrincetonU bent spoon Princeton is not on Ello Move over, Google+ Vine Â  Snapchat Yik Yak. Just when higher ed social media managers thought they had a handle on the latest social media trend, a newer, trendier platform comes along. However, looking at the list above should remind us that this is nothing new. Ello, the (currently) invite-only and anti-advertising social media platform, is here and itâ€™s making news. Created by a group of artists and programmers and made semi-public this past summer, Ello seems to be meant for people who are still into social media but are over the feeling of being marketed to.Â  Regardless of Elloâ€™s ultimate success, the excitement it has generated should give higher ed social media managers something to think about. Â  Are we contributing to our potentially fleeing audience membersâ€™ feelings of being marketed to? When a prospective studentâ€™s Facebook feed turns black and white because every department at every school is posting Throwback Thursday photos - when a universityâ€™s text posts promoting campus deals show up in studentsâ€™ Instagram feedsÂ  - when we use the same memes our followers see everywhere else on the internet - when our Facebook and Twitter feeds are connectedâ€¦Does that come off as unoriginal? Is it seen as inauthentic? And if soâ€”assuming the view of Ello users is that advertising is an inauthentic mediaâ€”then are we contributing to our audience membersâ€™ feelings of needing to go somewhere else? Itâ€™s a series of questions that brings up more questions, but theyâ€™re questions that need to be answered; a discussion that should be had before asking, â€œShould we be on Ello?â€? Because if the content weâ€™re sharing contributes to making audience members want to abandon current platforms, how are they going to feel when they get to Ello and see another post asking them to use #YourSchoolHereAutumn?Â  A current search for â€œUniversityâ€? on Ello shows that several schools have already committed to an Ello presence. It is yet to be seen if when Ello opens up to more users their students will find the new platform to be a unique social experience, or not much different from the ones they already know. Â Obviously, the first scenario would be preferable from the social media managerâ€™s standpoint. However, if the savvy Ello user recognizes a university as a brand, then isnâ€™t it likely that they wouldnâ€™t even be interested in interacting? Questions, questions, questionsâ€¦ As social media professionals, we should always put our audience first. In Elloâ€™s case, the best thing we can do for our audience may be to stay away. Let them interact with us where they want to interact with us and make that experience as rewarding as possible. And if we ask ourselves the questions that need to be asked and it turns out that students want their school on Ello?

Great shot. Now what? Here at Princeton social media, we post photos across many platforms. Weâ€™re on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and Snapchat all of which are photo-friendly. So how do we decide where to post a shot? Itâ€™s not an exact science. But in general, if a photo makes us feel like weâ€™re in the company of a bunch of good friends and its tag-able, we like to see it on Facebook. If itâ€™s a campus shot that makes us feel like weâ€™re being transported to a far-off land (or Hogwarts), we post it to Instagram. When an image is related to something newsworthy or historic, weâ€™ll often share it via Twitter. As for Snapchat, wellâ€¦Â  add Princeton_U and see for yourself! No matter the platform, we usually â€œcamera rollâ€? with a photo credit. On Instagram, we add a #Princetagram tag, much to the dismay of Prince fans worldwide. For a photo to be posted on Princeton social media, it has to feature some measure of beauty or relevance or humor or Princetoniana or at least a cute squirrel. Here are some examples. Can you guess where we posted each of these photos? - Jill Feldman, Social Media Specialist 4 notes 1 month ago Princeton University Social media photography Facebook Instagram Twitter higher ed hesm Dalai Lama Hogwarts Neon The Arts at Princeton Tumblr Jamie Saxon is the humanities writer in the Office of Communications I think I just wanted to be able to say Princeton s newest social media baby. Sounds like a Vanity Fair cover, right? â€” JLaw, are you available? George, Brad, anyone? But that s not really true. The Arts at Princeton Tumblr was the solution to an identity crisis: how to capture the breadth of Princeton students experiences in the arts when the arts happen all over campus, not just at the Lewis Center . Here, a Vanity Fair-style profile of Princeton s newest social media baby. Birthdate: July 21, 2014, 5 p.m. Provenance: I needed a visually compelling format to showcase the vibrant spectrum of opportunities in the arts that Princeton students enjoy. A photo gallery? Yawn. A slideshow? So yesterday. Where s the snap, crackle, pop? Then, in the middle of a yoga class (not kidding), just when I was supposed to be acknowledging my thoughts and letting them go, it hit me: the arts at Princeton are captured on smartphones, video and the Web â€” and shared on social media. I needed to get this party started on social media, and Tumblr was the venue. Bloodline: Tumblr is a visually driven social media platform â€” technically a blog, but also a cross between Pinterest (think virtual bulletin board) and Instagram (think gorgeous and intriguing photos). Photos and quotes (believe it or not) are especially popular. Videos, not so much. Who loves you, baby? One of Tumblr s largest demographics is users aged 16-18 â€” bingo! Think prospective Princeton students â€” but it s also popular with the 18-35 set (male and female) â€” peeps who just love cool photos or, in this case, are really into the arts. Breakout role: In the first week the Arts at Princeton Tumblr launched, Tumblr.com put the blog on its trending list. We went form zero to wickedly close to 3,000 followers the first month! #randomluck, #makemomproud What s in your closet? I try to post once or twice a day â€” below are some examples. (If a post has a lot of notes, it means it s getting liked and shared.) I look for arts faculty who are quoted in the media, performance photos, video trailers students make for upcoming shows, and gifs (makeagif.com is my new BFF). I add hashtags to try to draw Tumblr-ites with different interests (#poetry, #studenttheater, #MerylStreep). I also share posts from other University social media accounts (shout-out to Mudd Library for my Throwback Thursday photos) and websites. There is a Submit button at the top of the Tumblr for others to submit posts (you don t have to have a Tumblr account to submit.) I want to be just like you: Tumblr is great for when you have photos, student comments or quotes, and videos coming in from a lot of sources â€” like breakout trips or study abroad or freshman orientation and you want to curate and share in one place.
