Guthman, who graduated from Georgia Tech in 1956 with a degree in industrial engineering, was actively involved in public service in the Atlanta area for over 20 years. In 1998 he founded the Margaret Guthman Keyboard Competition as a tribute to his wife, Margaret. What began as a jazz piano competition has expanded to become the Margaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition, a two-day annual event that brings together musicians from all over the world competing for the prize of â€œbest new musical instrument.â€? Jason Freeman, associate professor of music, said â€œRichardâ€™s open mindedness, genuine curiosity, and spirit of collaboration set the tone for the competition which turned the Guthman into a spirited community of practitioners sharing innovative ideas as much as a competition of the worldâ€™s greatest instrument designers.â€? He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Margaret; son Richard â€œRickâ€? Guthman III and his wife, Libby; son William â€œBillâ€? Guthman and his wife, Cheryl; son Dan Wall and his wife, Carol; and several grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that gifts in Richardâ€™s honor be made in support of the Guthman Competition or the Temple of Atlanta. If you wish to make a gift to support the Guthman Competition, please make checks payable to the Georgia Tech Foundation, Inc. and send to Susan Sanders, Director of Development, 245 Fourth St, NW, Atlanta, GA 30332.

The project features a musical house, which is an immersive piece of architecture that performers play like an instrument. A free musical performance will be presented on Tuesday, Nov. 4 at 6:30 pm in the Ferst Center Amphitheater. The evening continues inside the Ferst Center with the Georgia Tech Symphony Orchestra performing its season opener "Romantic Mastersâ€? at 7:30 pm, joined by Peter Ciaschini, Concertmaster of the Atlanta Opera. New Orleans Airlift is sponsored by the Georgia Tech Office of the Arts, School of Music, School of Industrial Design, Center for Music Technology, and College of Architecture. The project will be located at the Amphitheatre located to the side of the Ferst Center for the Arts and the musical house will be open for anyone to play throughout the semester. The idea of Musical Architecture was conceived by artists Delaney Martin, Taylor Lee Shepherd, and Swoon of New Orleans Airlift in 2010. Inspired by a decrepit 18th century creole cottage and seeking to imaginatively reuse the cottageâ€™s salvaged materials, they combined music and architecture into an idea for a house that could be played like an instrument. The original project, titled The Music Box, was hugely successful and the concept has continued in other locations around the world where new iterations reflect local music and culture. New Orleans Airlift served as artists-in-residence at Georgia Tech last spring, and Tech students from the GT Center for Music Technology created a musical architecture project in collaboration with students from industrial design, human-computer interaction, and architecture. New Orleans Airlift has returned to Atlanta this fall, and continued working with Tech students to create the newest Musical Architecture project. It will debut in Atlanta at the Goat Farm Halloween Event on October 31 and then will move to the Amphitheatre located to the side of the Ferst Center where it will remain throughout the semester.

Tech Alumna Catie Newell is hosting an exhibit of her work in the Stubbins Gallery through Nov. 7. --> After Curfew, the Works of Artist Catie Newell What defines art? Is it the representation of an abstract idea or just one that dwells within? Alumna Catie Newell tackles this question in her exhibit, After Curfew , which opened at the Stubbins Gallery in the College of Architecture last week. â€œCatie's practice is remarkable, not just for the notice and awards it has received, or even for its beauty and strength, but also because it describes and explores a particularly engaging and relevant way of working, one that we were keen to put into the view of our students and others in the academic and professional community," said Mark Cottle, associate professor in the School of Architecture and chair of the Stubbins Gallery Committee. Newell graduated from the College of Architecture after changing majors from aerospace engineering in 2003. â€œApproaching architecture with an interest in design, travel, and implications of space opened up my thinking for my pursuit of architecture moving forward,â€? she said. She went on to pursue a Master of Architecture degree at Rice University, where she began her installation work. Her idea of intertwining architecture and art into a form where they are representative of the same concept began to emerge. This led her to work at the firm Office dA in Boston, where she developed as an architect and began to cultivate her passions in a more spatially defining way. How does it feel to have your work represented at your alma mater? It is a treasure to return and reflect. What was your source of inspiration for this particular exhibit, â€œAfter Curfewâ€?? After Curfew is a survey of all of the material research and installations that I have done over the last five years. Coming back from a year residency at the American Academy in Rome, the timing felt perfect to take stock in all the work that has been done in quite an intense set of years. Itâ€™s wonderful to present it in a way that is new for the work â€” in location and time. Is this inspiration constantly present in some way in all of your works? The inspirations for me that are constantly present are: the current circumstances affecting a particular setting â€” in particular urban issues. Iâ€™ve also developed a keen eye for illumination, and more importantly for darkness. Those effects are always present in my work. When it comes to developing the work, I work carefully with materials and effects to alter existing spaces. Pulling all of these factors my focus. How do you know what materials will provide the best atmosphere or mood for the theme you are going for? Oftentimes, there is a resonance with the space and its darkness or illumination. I use materials that are somehow tied to the space. They generally carry a commentary or reflection on the space; dialing in to the conditions that are present. Would you ever consider doing a project on the same scale as â€œSalvaged Landscapeâ€? or â€œWeatherizingâ€? (both installations with Alibi Studio) in Atlanta? I would love to! It would be a joy and an honor. It is my dream to travel the world, doing these works as a way to celebrate and research the material cultures distinct to each place. When coming up with an idea and trying to capture it physically, do you ever come across materialistic challenges? By this I mean, are there many physical constraints when it comes to preparing a gallery for a show that may be entirely focused on the visualization of something such as glass? Challenges are everywhere! The trick for me is to not see them as a stumbling block or an error. I like to use things opportunistically. I like constraints. They help me make amazing design decisions and surprises, and in the end it has a better relationship to the host space. What is your favorite part about the exhibits that you have been involved with and have personally put on? The people that get involved. For After Curfew , my best friend and a collaborator I often work with, Joe Proper, came with me. For several of my Detroit projects, my father worked closely with me to help with the installations. And the glasswork is in collaboration with my dear friend and colleague, Wes McGee. There is nothing sweeter than good collaborations and making things with people that mean a lot to you. After Curfew will be on display in the Stubbins Gallery from now through Nov. 7. The Stubbins Gallery is located in the Architecture East Building, at 245 Fourth Street NW, Atlanta, Ga., 30332. Stubbins Gallery is open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Related Links College of Architecture Contact Nihit Tiwari Institute Communications Media Attention Tech students!

With support from the Georgia Tech Arts Advisory Board, however, the other eight will remain on permanent display. The Arts Advisory Board has been instrumental in establishing a Challenge Grant of $150,000 to inspire further charitable gifts specifically for the acquisition of art through the newly created Art Acquisition Fund. The Challenge Grant will match dollar-for-dollar gifts to support the acquisition of art for the campus and accelerate a permanent collection of enduring quality for the Georgia Tech community to enjoy. It will serve as the funding source for the eight sculptures in the exhibition curated by John Henry, the internationally acclaimed, Chattanooga-based sculptor. â€œWe are grateful for the support of the Arts Advisory Board in the establishment of an Arts Acquisition Fund that will allow Georgia Tech to acquire a large portion of the Engineered Art collection, and acquire additional pieces as the opportunity presents itself,â€? said Board Chair Sonny Seals. â€œThe Arts Advisory Board has accomplished a lot in a short period of time. It should be noted that a substantial portion of the board are not Tech alumni â€“ they are friends of Tech who understand the importance of the arts to the Institute as we embrace a more arts-centric student experience.â€? The Engineered Art exhibition is part of Arts@Tech, an initiative to enhance the Georgia Tech community by fostering programs and events spanning the arts spectrum â€“ at the intersection of technological innovation and creative expression. Arts@Tech is an outcome of the Instituteâ€™s Strategic Plan. â€œLast year was the first in which the Arts@Tech initiative started to drive activity on campus,â€? said Aaron Bobick, chair of the faculty-led Council of the Arts. â€œThe Engineered Art sculpture exhibit explicitly announced to the community that there is a deep interest in the role of art in fostering both reflection and creativity in all that we do.â€?

Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs, and William Schafer, vice president for Student Affairs, are pleased to announce the appointment of A. Madison Cario as the director of the Office of the Arts at Georgia Tech effective August 4, 2014. Cario comes to Tech from The Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was named director of Student Engagement last year. She has served as the director of Special Artistic Initiatives for the past four years, as well as the director of Operations and Facilities for the past seven years. â€œIt is an honor to welcome Madison Cario to the arts leadership team,â€? Bras said. â€œMy conversations with her make me confident that under Madisonâ€™s leadership Arts@Tech will continue to use the arts on campus to strengthen the research and study areas in significant ways. I want to take the opportunity to thank Joe Bankoff, chair of the Nunn School for International Affairs, for leading the search. My appreciation extends to all the members of the committee.â€? The primary charge of the Office of the Arts is to enhance the creativity of Georgia Tech students and faculty through engagement and participation in performing and visual arts experiences. There are various opportunities for the Office of the Arts to connect with the both the academic and student communities of the Institute. Georgia Tech has a culture of innovation throughout its campus, and there is a need to connect and use the arts on campus to strengthen the research and study areas in significant ways. The new Office of the Arts Director will actively seek out these connection points to find opportunities for creative expression. The director is responsible for the Arts@Tech initiativeâ€™s operation, financial performance, and programming, including the operations and programming of the Ferst Center, a role formerly under the then director of the Ferst Center for the Arts. Cario said she is looking forward to her new role. â€œI cannot imagine a more exhilarating and inspiring place to be than here, right in the middle of the intersection of arts and technology,â€? Cario said. â€œWith creative competency essential to global competitiveness in the 21st century, Arts at Tech is, simply put, the right idea at the right time.â€? In her roles with The Annenberg Center, Cario created strong connections with student performing arts groups through several initiatives to increase student participation and sense of belonging at the Center. She altered By Local programming â€” a performance series designed to bring local artists to campus â€” to favor more innovative, process-oriented work. She also supported experimental cross-genre work with artists interested in collaborating with students, and utilized non-traditional spaces for performance resulting in higher student attendance. Georgia Techâ€™s Office of the Arts reports to Schafer, vice president for Student Affairs. â€œI am pleased to welcome Madison Cario as the new director of the Office of the Arts,â€? Schafer said. â€œIn addition to her background in the performing arts, Madison has great experience working with student engagement in the arts. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing the impact she will have on Georgia Tech students and faculty.â€? Cario holds a Master of Science in Environmental Studies from the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor of Arts in Rhetoric and Communication, Summa Cum Laude, from Temple University.

"Bud" Peterson, and distinguished guests from around the world joined Ivan Allen College Dean Jacqueline J. Royster on Thursday, May 17 to introduce a spectacular exhibition of African art and artifacts to Atlanta. The signature event of the Collegeâ€™s Africa Atlanta 2014 initiative, this exhibition is expanding perceptions of Georgia Tech as a catalyst for Atlantaâ€™s global engagement and economic growth. The exhibition, Kongo across the Waters, features more than 120 historic and contemporary pieces spanning more than five centuries. It is the first American museum exhibition to deeply explore the legacy of Africaâ€™s Kongo culture and reveal cultural connections across multiple centuries and continents. The exhibition features loans from the Royal Museum for Central Africa that have never before been exhibited in the U.S., as well as significant archaeological discoveries from the Kongo diaspora, including colonoware pottery from a recent excavation at the Dean Hall Plantation in South Carolina. Also highlighted are recent works by Steve Bandoma, Edouard Duval CarriÃ©, JosÃ© Bedia, RenÃ©e Stout, and Radcliffe Bailey, contemporary artists who draw from the Kongo artistic tradition. The inspiration and centerpiece for Africa Atlanta 2014, the cross-cultural perspectives evoked by the exhibition, by a companion international conference Africa Beyond Africa: The Future of Cultural, Social, and Scientific Research, and by an array of activities mounted by the College and nearly 50 partner organizations, are bringing a new dimension to the international profile of Atlanta and Georgia Tech. In remarks to the more than 300 guests who attended the opening reception for the exhibition, Georgia Tech President Peterson highlighted the extraordinary collaboration of local, national, and international partners across four continents brought together by Dean Royster as part of the initiative. â€œAfrica Atlanta 2014 richly embodies Georgia Techâ€™s strategic commitment to support the economic development of our region and global engagement,â€? said President Peterson. â€œThrough the work of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and that of the many distinguished partners and sponsors of this initiative, we are helping to increase understanding of contemporary Africa and global, cross-cultural innovation bridging liberal arts and technologies.â€? With a burgeoning middle class, a collective GDP on par with that of Russia and Brazil, and the worldâ€™s fastest growing youth population, Africa is an emerging global sociopolitical force and marketplace. Dean Royster views the initiative and exhibition as gateway opportunities for Atlanta and the Institute to build contemporary bonds, not only in the realms of arts and culture, but also in business and innovation, education, and global affairs including health and human rights. â€œGeopolitically, Atlanta is at a critical location within the trans-Atlantic triangle of Africa, Europe and the Americas,â€? said Royster, who brought the exhibition to Atlanta. â€œWe have a chance to reinvent what it means to be Southern due to continuously evolving relationships within that space and the richness of the diasporic communities that call Atlanta home â€” to be a pacesetting 21st-century city and a trans-Atlantic beacon.â€? Numerous attendees at the reception expressed a new awareness of the Ivan Allen College and liberal arts at Georgia Tech. In addition to a tour of the exhibition, the reception included remarks by President Jimmy Carter, His Excellency Johan Verbeke, ambassador of Belgium to the U.S; Alexander Cummings Jr., executive vice president and chief administrative officer of the Coca-Cola Company who is a native of Liberia; Guido Gryseels, director general of the Royal Museum for Central Africa. The Honorable Kwanza Hall also spoke, announcing on behalf of the Atlanta City Council a proclamation recognizing Africa Atlanta 2014 â€œfor bringing a new dimension to the cityâ€™s profile and engagement as an international city.â€? President Peterson announced Beatrice Mtetwa as a recipient of the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage. The first woman to receive the prize, Mtetwa is a human rights attorney from Zimbabwe. The announcement of the prize during the premier event of Africa Atlanta 2014 highlighted the global affairs aspect of the initiative which includes upcoming activities focused on health and human rights. Mtetwa has fought against injustice and defended press freedom for more than 20 years. She has endured harassment and arrest as she has advocated for human rights, social justice and womenâ€™s equality and advancement. Atlanta is the second leg of a four city tour for Kongo across the Waters . On view at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum from May 17 to September 21, public attendance on opening day this past Saturday was robust.
