The Allen Prize is an award given by Georgia Tech to individuals who, by asserting moral principle, have positively affected public discourse at the risk of their careers, livelihoods, and sometimes lives. Â  Ms. Mtetwa has been internationally recognized for her indefatigable fight against injustice and has dedicated her life to representing those persecuted under the Robert Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. In 2009, she became the only African other than Nelson Mandela to win the prestigious Ludovic-Trarieux International Human Rights Prize. Â  â€œShe permits us to connect, in a very dramatic way, the legacy of Ivan Allen Jr., for whom the award is named, to courageous social and ethical action as a global need and commitment,â€? said Jackie Royster, dean of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and a member of the awardâ€™s nominating committee.
