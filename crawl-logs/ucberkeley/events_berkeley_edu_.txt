The UC Botanical Garden will be the only West Coast showing of the exhibition. October 8, 2014 – March 6, 2015  every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Friday | Bancroft Library This exhibit portrays California both as a vast landscape of mountains, ocean, and forests and as an intimate home for vastly different inhabitants. Scenes of Yosemite and the Gold Rush are displayed, along with more recent work such as colorful paintings by John Sackas of the Golden Gate Produce Market. Also featured are Augustus John’s vibrant portrait of San Francisco’s tennis champion Helen Wills, and an imposing painting by Charles Grant of the Great White Fleet entering the Golden Gate on May 5th 1908. The exhibit conveys the variety of artistic prisms through which the Golden State has been captured on canvas. Wednesday, December 31 | 12-2 p.m. | Lawrence Hall of Science Make 2015 a year for science by ringing in the New Year at the Lawrence Hall of Science. Bring your entire family to this New Year's Eve for a relaxing and enriching day of fun. Count down to 2015 in our Science on a Sphere exhibit while observing what happens as the clock strikes midnight in different time zones around the world. At 2:00 p.m. here in Berkeley, cheer as hundred of balloons mark our celebration of the New Year—held at that afternoon hour because we know that, hard as we might try, not everyone can stay up until midnight.
