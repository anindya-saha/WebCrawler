Dec 18, 2014 IRVINE, Calif. --- UC Irvine student-athletes and staff partnered with the UCI Police Department on Thursday (Dec. 18) in delivering gifts to children receiving care at the UC Irvine Medical Center. The annual Teddy Bear Toy Drive provides the UCI student-athletes, staff members and law enforcement officers the opportunity to bring gifts and spend time with the families. Gifts were delivered to children in areas such as the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, burn and emergency units. The UCI student-athletes were delighted to have the opportunity to be involved. "I'm so grateful to take part in this amazing opportunity to give back, said Jaycee McNally from the women s water polo team. I am so fortunate to be able to team up with the UCI Police Department and Athletics to give back to the community and gain some valuable perspective. It was very humbling to see all the families and their strength. I hope to continue on to medical school after finishing my undergraduate degree at UCI and I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to learn from my experience today." "It was an amazing experience to give gifts to so many brave young people, men s soccer player Mats Bjurman said. It's hard to describe how rewarding it was to give a gift to a young child going through so much, but I was honored to be able to do so." Today was a very humbling experience, said Arden Davis, a member of the UCI women s volleyball program. Seeing how appreciative the kids, families, and nurses were in receiving the toys made me realize how small acts can make a great difference. I'm excited to have been able to share in such an amazing experience with my fellow Anteaters! __________________________________________________________ For UC Irvine Athletics ticket information, please call (949) 824-5000 or e-mail athletics.tickets@uci.edu .
