--> Minimum wage increases result in job loss, UCI-led study reaffirms | UCIrvine News For Journalists Health News Subscribe Media Advisories Press Releases UCIrvine News Search News Submit Arts Development Studies and a 2013 UCI Ph.D. graduate, and William Wascher, economist with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C. The finding is consistent with that of their previously published work, summarized in the 2008 book Minimum Wages . The new study addresses the current dispute about comparison groups used to estimate the effects of past minimum wage increases â€“ an ongoing challenge in evaluating any policy because researchers cannot observe the same economy with and without the policy, Neumark noted. Recent work has contested the use of broad U.S. comparisons that measure employment changes in states with minimum wage increases versus those without, arguing that only adjacent states or counties should be used as comparisons. When the parameters were narrowed in this way to adjust for what would have happened had the minimum wage not gone up, researchers assert, there was no net decrease in employment. â€œThese studies raise a good question: What do you use as a comparison or proxy group for states where the minimum wage increased?â€? Neumark said. â€œIt turns out that it doesnâ€™t matter.â€? His new analysis shows that when gauging the effects of minimum wage hikes with either comparison method â€“ one restricted by proximity or one taking a broader view â€“ the evidence consistently points to net job loss over a span of one to two years. â€œThere are a lot of strong opinions about low wages and how much employers should pay workers. But we have to separate our feelings about low wages from the evidence on the effects of the government simply requiring employers to pay higher wages,â€? Neumark said. â€œThe data and the evidence tell us that a higher minimum wage results in job loss for low-skilled workers. We may be willing to accept that job loss in return for other benefits of higher wages for some workers, but we canâ€™t pretend there will be no lost jobs.â€?
