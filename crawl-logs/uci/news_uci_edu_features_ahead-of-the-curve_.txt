And when I challenged colleges to reduce their energy use by 20 percent by 2020, UC Irvine went ahead and did it last year. Done. So UC Irvine is ahead of the curve. All of you are ahead of the curve.â€? In this pivotal year, UCI saw new leadership come aboard. Former provost and executive vice chancellor Howard Gillman became the campusâ€™s sixth chancellor after Drake left for Ohio State University. He has worked aggressively with deans to retain and attract top-flight faculty . The 2013-14 cohort of 77 recruits is one of the largest ever at UCI and includes 13 full professors and one dean. Gillman hailed the newcomers as â€œpeople who make us better by bringing fresh perspectives and even higher aspirations for impact in our disciplines and on our world.â€? In addition, the chancellor continues leading the implementation of academic initiatives he instituted as provost to help foster multidisciplinary projects that transcend traditional university boundaries. They include: Data Science ; Medical Humanities ; Water UCI ; Sustainability ; Exercise Medicine Sport Sciences ; and Illuminations, the Arts Culture Initiative . â€œMy experiences this past year,â€? Gillman said, â€œconvince me that UCI is poised to rise higher in the ranks of those global institutions of higher education whose preeminence is undisputed because they are viewed as making the very best and most important contributions to knowledge creation, education, arts and culture, clinical and professional practice, and human well-being.â€? Those values of optimism, innovation and excellence have always been shared by UCIâ€™s dynamic student population, now numbering more than 30,000. And this fallâ€™s newcomers â€“ drawn from a record 82,615 applicants â€“ are primed to follow suit. Eighty percent of these freshmen are California residents, with 20 percent from out of state or around the globe, demonstrating a growing national and international interest in UCI. They also reflect the campusâ€™s diversity â€“ 38 percent of in-state freshmen are from underrepresented minority groups: 3 percent are African American, compared with 2.6 percent last year, and 28.9 percent are Latino, compared with 25.9 percent last year. Nearly 36 percent of freshmen are from low-income backgrounds, a testament to the University of Californiaâ€™s commitment to accessibility â€“ as demonstrated by aid programs such as the Blue Gold Opportunity Plan â€“ and the availability of federal and state assistance. These talented and driven students are entering college at a time when the nationâ€™s and worldâ€™s challenges â€“ from political gridlock and underemployment to overpopulation and the damaging effects of climate change â€“ seem almost too difficult to solve. But Obama, during his commencement address, provided hope they can draw upon in the coming years: â€œIâ€™m here to tell you: Donâ€™t believe the cynicism. Guard against it. Donâ€™t buy into it. â€¦ I want to show you how badly we need you â€“ both your individual voices and your collective efforts â€“ to give you the chance you seek to change the world and maybe even save it.â€?
