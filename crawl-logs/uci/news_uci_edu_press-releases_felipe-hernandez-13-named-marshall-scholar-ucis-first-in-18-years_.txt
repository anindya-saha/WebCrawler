He hopes to study how policy can help reduce barriers to success for first- and second-generation immigrant students and to research the effects of policy strategy and socioeconomic mobility. â€œBy analyzing this complex issue through a scholarly comparative lens, combined with my work and personal experience, I will learn to develop social policies that can mobilize these communities â€“ first in California and then worldwide,â€? Hernandez said. He previously won a Harry S. Truman Scholarship and a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant grant that took him to Colombiaâ€™s University of Ibague. In addition, Hernandez interned for U.S. Rep. Linda Sanchez through the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute and at the U.S. Department of Education under the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics. After returning from his Fulbright year abroad, he took part in a Roadtrip Nation documentary about successful first-generation American leaders across the country. Hernandez is currently participating in the Capital Fellows Program in Sacramento. â€œAs a world traveler, I actively share my narrative of being a first-generation Latino from a low-income community,â€? he said. â€œIn Colombia, my story transformed my studentsâ€™ opinions about the U.S., and they further opened their minds and willingness to travel internationally and create friendships.â€? Hernandez has benefited greatly from UC Irvineâ€™s Scholarship Opportunities Program, launched in 1990 to help undergraduates win prestigious scholarships. It serves applicants for 12 annual awards, including the postgraduate Marshall Scholarship, providing them with the communication skills â€“ writing, editing, public speaking and interviewing â€“ needed to compete successfully for top awards. Students who work with SOP learn how to evaluate and strengthen their talents and interests to achieve their academic and career goals. The program also manages the university-level application evaluation and endorsement process for scholarships requiring nomination or endorsement. For more information, visit scholars.uci.edu .
