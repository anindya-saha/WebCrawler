The method has the potential to transform the way deep-tissue tumors and diseases are treated. UMD Professor Benjamin Shapiro , Fischell Department of Bioengineering (BioE) and the Institute for Systems Research , and UMD alum Aleksandar Nacev (Aerospace B.S. â€™09, BioE Ph.D. â€™13) Â teamed up with Weinberg Medical Physics to exploit fast pulsed magnetic fields to focus nano-therapeutic magnetic particles to deep targets. Their advances in this area were recently published in the journal Nano Letters . For years, researchers have worked with magnetic nano-particles loaded with therapies â€“ such as drugs or genes â€“ to develop noninvasive techniques to direct therapies and diagnostics to targets in the body. Magnetic nanoparticle research garnered media attention in October, when Google X (Googleâ€™s innovation lab dedicated to furthering major technological advancements) announced its interest in the use of magnetic nano-particles for diagnostic applications.Â  Instead of surgery or systemically administered treatments, such as chemotherapy, the use of magnetic particles as drug carriers could potentially allow clinicians to use external electromagnets to focus therapy to the precise locations of a disease within a patient. However, until now, particles could only be attracted to a magnet, and thus could not be concentrated to points away from the magnet face. As a result, in prior clinical trials magnets held outside the body had only been able to concentrate treatment to targets at or just below the skin surface.Â  "What we have shown experimentally is that by exploiting the physics of nanorods we can use fast pulsed magnetic fields to focus the particles to a deep target between the magnets," Shapiro said.Â  These pulsed magnetic fields allowed the team to reverse the usual behavior of magnetic nano-particles. Instead of a magnet attracting the particles, they showed that an initial magnetic pulse can orient the rod-shaped particles without pulling them, and then a subsequent pulse can push the particles before the particles can reorient. By repeating the pulses in sequence, the particles were focused to locations deep between the electromagnets.Â  "The Holy Grail of magnetic drug targeting is the dream of using magnets outside the body to minimally-invasively direct drug therapy to anywhere inside the body, for example, to inoperable deep tumors or to sections of the brain that have been damaged by trauma, vascular or degenerative diseases,â€? said Dr. Irving Weinberg, a practicing physician and president of Weinberg Medical Physics. â€œWe have shown that fast pulsing of external electromagnetic fields may be able to achieve this goal." Their study in Nano Letters, â€œ Dynamic Inversion Enables External Magnets to Concentrate Ferromagnetic Rods to a Central Target ,â€? shows that, with appropriate external magnetic pulses, ferromagnetic particles carrying drugs or molecules could be concentrated to arbitrary deep locations between magnets. Nacev, Weinberg, Shapiro and their fellow researchers are now working to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this method in a project funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Small Business Innovation Research program and featured at the NCI-sponsored Investor Conference in San Francisco. Additionally, the research team recently launched IronFocus Medical, Inc. , a startup company established to commercialize their invention. A video showing the magnetic focusing can be seen at http://ter.ps/magnetic . Â  "This technology could enable a new therapeutic modality that combines the spatial precision of traditional image-guided radiation with the biochemical specificity of molecular medicine," said Dr. John R. Adler , Vice President and Chief of New Clinical Applications for Varian Medical Systems .

At 14 months, infants and their parents were observed in the lab to see how the babies responded to brief separations from their parents. Infants were classified as having a secure or insecure attachment to their parent based on this in-depth observation. To test the second risk factor, childrenâ€™s behavioral inhibition and social reticence was observed in the lab as they encountered new situations and new peers several times across early childhood (at 14, 24, 48, and 84 months). Parents also completed questionnaires about their childrenâ€™s behavior in new situations and with unfamiliar peers. Based on the lab observations and results from parentsâ€™ questionnaires, the researchers classified children according to how inhibited or shy they were over time.Â  Years later (when the children were 14 to 17 years old), participants and their parents completed questionnaires about the adolescentsâ€™ anxiety. Youths who said that they often felt nervous going to parties, dances, or other places where there would be people they didnâ€™t know well, and often felt nervous when they had to do something in front of an audience like read, speak, or play a game or sport, scored higher on social anxiety than youth who said they had such feelings less frequently. The study concluded that children who were both insecurely attached to their parents as infants and who were inhibited throughout their childhoods went on to have higher levels of anxiety as adolescents, specifically social anxiety. Teen males who were insecurely attached to their parents as infants and who were inhibited across early childhood were at the most risk for social anxiety. In addition, the association between childhood inhibition and adolescent social anxiety was strongest for children who reacted angrily and werenâ€™t able to calm down when reunited with their parents (during the lab task at 14 months), compared to children who showed other types of attachment patterns as infants. "Our study suggests that it is the combination of both early risk factors that predicts anxiety in adolescence, particularly social anxiety," saidÂ  Erin Lewis-Morrarty ,Â  Â  Share Email Print Read more Caret to Return to Maryland as USM Chancellor December 17, 2014 Share Email Print Contacts: Anne Moultrie 301-445-2722 Mike Lurie Caret to bring 20 years of successful higher education leadership ADELPHI, Md. - After a successful tenure as president of the five-campus University of Massachusetts system, Robert L. Caret will return to Maryland as chancellor of the University System of Maryland. James L. Shea , chairman of the USM Board of Regents , today announced the board's appointment of Caret, effective July 1, 2015. Caret served as president of Towson University , one of USM's 12 institutions, from 2003 to 2011. "The Board of Regents is very pleased that Bob Caret will take the helm as USM's fourth chancellor," said Shea. "He brings years of experience as the outstanding leader of two public universities and a public system of higher education. He is adept at building partnerships that benefit institutions and the surrounding communities. And he is very familiar with USM and the state of Maryland. We are confident that he will provide the visionary and innovative leadership the University System of Maryland needs to continue to enhance opportunities for our students and our state." Details follow at the end of this news release regarding an introductory news conference in Baltimore at 2:30 p.m., Friday, Dec. 19. "I am extending my heartiest congratulations to Robert Caret as the next Chancellor of the University System of Maryland, and I ask the entire campus community to join me in welcoming him back home to Maryland," said University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh. As president of the University of Massachusetts (UMass) since July 2011, Caret has become a major spokesperson on the pressing issues of college affordability and student debt. Throughout his UMass tenure, he has emphasized efficiency, rolling out several cost-saving initiatives, and established productive working relationships with Massachusetts government and business leaders. His successful pursuit of a 50-50 funding formula for UMass resulted in the state and students contributing equally to the university's general education program and a 22 percent increase in the base budget for two years. He also secured additional state funding, allowing UMass to freeze tuition and mandatory fees for in-state undergraduate students for two consecutive years. Before joining UMass, Caret was president of Towson University (TU) for eight years, where he also served as a faculty member, dean, executive vice president and provost during his more than 25-year tenure there. At Towson, he created partnerships with regional business, non-profit and civic organizations; raised student graduation rates; and undertook a capital fundraising and building campaign to support campus infrastructure improvements. He oversaw an increase in the university's online courses and expanded the availability of TU courses at regional higher education centers. He was instrumental in establishing Towson University in Northeaster Maryland, which offers transfer students the flexibility to pursue a four-year degree after completing an associate's degree at a community college. The facility is located on the grounds of Harford Community College.Â  From 1995 to 2003, Caret served as president of San Jose State University (SJSU), part of the California State University System. He is credited with bringing a vision for SJSU as the metropolitan university of Silicon Valley. "I am excited and energized to return to Maryland and the University System of Maryland," said Caret. "I have dedicated 29 years of my professional career to the system and the state and to two primary goals: to ensure we provide high-quality, affordable education and that we continue to build a research-based economic engine. Â I look forward to working to ensure those two goals remain central to all that we do." Active in the national higher education community, Caret serves on the National Association of System Heads and American Council on Education boards. He also is a member of the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board and the Government University Industry Research Roundtable. In Massachusetts, Caret has served on the boards of several organizations, including the Governor's STEM Advisory Council, Massachusetts Life Sciences Center, Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, and Edward M. Kennedy Institute. Caret holds a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of New Hampshire and a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Suffolk University in Boston. When Caret joins the USM next year, he will succeed William E. Kirwan, who in May announced his plans to step down from the chancellor's position after a career of more than 50 years in public higher education. Kirwan will remain in the position until Caret is on board. "I've known Bob Caret for several years," said Kirwan. "He has had significant positive impact on each institution he has led. The University System of Maryland and the state will benefit greatly from his leadership in the years ahead." Caret's appointment follows a six-month, extensive national search led by Rick Berndt, chair of the search-and-screening committee; managing partner of Gallagher Evelius Jones LLP, a Baltimore law firm; and a former USM regent. "We deeply appreciate the diligent work of the search committee," said Chairman Shea on behalf of the USM Board of Regents. "Under Rick Berndt's excellent leadership, the committee carefully reviewed the applicants and nominees, and forwarded highly qualified finalists to the board for consideration." The University System of Maryland comprises 12 institutions: Â Bowie State University; Coppin State University; Frostburg State University; Salisbury University; Towson University; University of Baltimore; University of Maryland, Baltimore; University of Maryland, Baltimore County; University of Maryland, College Park; University of Maryland Eastern Shore; University of Maryland University College; and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Studies. USM also includes two regional centers: Â Universities at Shady Grove and University System of Maryland at Hagerstown, at which USM universities offer upper-division (undergraduate junior- and senior-levels) and graduate courses. Systemwide, student enrollment exceeds 162,000. USM and its institutions compete successfully for more than $1 billion in external grants and contracts annually.
