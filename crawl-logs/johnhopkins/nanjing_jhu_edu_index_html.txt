The remainingÂ 11 courses will depend on a student's concentration.Â  In general, a student must take six courses toward his or her concentration, including the concentration seminar. For international students,Â nine courses (not including the thesis) must be taken in Chinese. Â  HNC Certificate/SAIS MAÂ  Â Â  Students who meet admissions requirements for both the HNC and SAIS complete two semesters in Nanjing and receive a Certificate in Chinese and American Studies, followed by two to three semesters at SAIS's Washington M.A. program. Through these joint programs, students can apply their regional and linguistic skills to the broader study of international relations or business.Â  Note: An offer of admission to either the Hopkins-Nanjing Center or to SAIS does not constitute admission to the other institution. Certificate Program (Two Semesters) The HNC awards a graduate certificate in Chinese and American Studies to students who attend the Center for one academic year and take a minimum of six courses in Mandarin. The certificate is a flexible interdisciplinary program in which students gain a deeper understanding of contemporary China and its modern history while pursuing the study of international relations, politics, law, economics and environmental issues.Â  Master of Arts (Two to Three Semesters) After completing the one year Certificate program at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center, HNC Certificate/SAIS MA students matriculate into the MA program in Washington, DC. The Washington, DC campus offers 18 different concentrations with an emphasis on international economics, global themes, world regions and languages. Learn more about the SAIS MA program here .Â  Chinese Language Proficiency International students take most of their courses in Chinese taught by Chinese faculty, while Chinese students are taught by international faculty with courses primarily in English. This target language curriculum is a unique feature of the HNC program that gives our graduates a competitive edge in the increasingly dynamic world of Sino-global relations. Chinese Proficiency Testing All applicants to Hopkins-Nanjing Center programs are required to take the Avant Assessment STAMP Chinese proficiency test.Â Students who intend to have further Chinese language study between taking the test and enrolling in the program should make this clear on the application, as this information can play a role inÂ admissionsÂ decisions. Â  Description The STAMP test is used to measure proficiency in understanding Mandarin and reading in Chinese. It is composed of two sections: listening comprehension and reading comprehension. Â It is an online multiple-choice testÂ thatÂ takes about two hours to complete. Â  NOTE: This test is meant to be challenging.Â  Do not be discouraged if you find it to be difficult! Â  As an adaptive test, questions become more difficult as you answer previous questions correctly.Â  Even if you do not know the answer to a question, try to answer to the best of your ability.Â  We have found students are generally pleasantly surprised by their score. We hope that all interested students will take the test to gauge their level rather than assuming their language ability is not high enough. You may know more than you think! Â  Testing Procedures First,Â applicants should find a proctor (a professor or supervisor at work) who will agreeÂ to administer the testÂ andÂ thenÂ completeÂ theÂ  STAMP test request form .Â Test materials will be emailed directly to the proctor, so be sure to include the proctor's current email address.Â Please email, mail or fax the form along with yourÂ  $25Â testing fee Â to: Â  The Hopkins-Nanjing Center Office of International Admissions, Rm 406 1740Â Massachusetts Avenue NW Washington, DC 20036 Fax: 202.663.7729 Email:Â  nanjing@jhu.edu Â  After you have completed the test, the HNC Office of International Admissions will notify you of your score within two business days. Â  The test cannot be taken more than twice in one year. All tests should be completed byÂ  the application deadline of the program to which you are applying.

Â  Tuition Financial Aid Â  Financial Information We understand that financingÂ an education at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center can be a challenge for some students.Â Below, weÂ present a basic tuition and housing fee break-downÂ forÂ our programsÂ and ways to financeÂ living and studyingÂ in Nanjing. The Hopkins-Nanjing CenterÂ offers substantial financial aid including grants based on a combination of merit and need, and student loans. To qualify for financial aid, please fill in the Financial Aid Application Form included in the HNC application. Students interested in federal loans should also submit the FAFSA online atÂ  www.fafsa.ed.gov . The HNC uses the SAIS Title IVÂ FAFSA code, which isÂ E00474. Applications received by theÂ FebruaryÂ application deadline will be given first priority for all available funds. Tuition and Fees The cost of the Hopkins-Nanjing Center's Certificate program is comparable to Chinese language programs in China. The cost of a master's degree is slightly less expensive than a SAIS master's degree in DC. The Center delivers a strong product through its academic program, its study and living facilities, its career development and its alumni network. We are certain that the benefits of the program far outweigh the costs, as it will increase your earning potential and contacts for the future. Estimated costs for the 2014-2015 academic year are: Â  Tuition, Certificate $22,500 Tuition, MAIS $39,964 Housing, Certificate $1,600 Housing, single occupancy $3,200 Housing, double occupancy $1,600 Health Insurance (estimated) $1,900 Matriculation Fee (non-refundable) $500 Note: All prices are estimates and subject to change. The school reserves the right to change information contained on this website without prior notice. Johns Hopkins health insurance is mandatory for all international students without comparable coverage. Additional Expenses International Airfare Board (estimated at around $8/day) Personal and Living Expenses Tuition bills are emailed in July and November. Tuition fees are due by the beginning of classes each semester Living Expenses The cost of living in Nanjing is low compared to the U.S., or even compared to Beijing and Shanghai. The amount individual students need to live will vary greatly depending on their habits and preferences, so it is difficult to predict precisely how much money an individual student will spend. Factors influencing the cost of living are frequency of eating outside the Center (especially at foreign restaurants) and the frequency and style of any traveling done during breaks. Fellowships The Hopkins-Nanjing Center has a financial aid budget to support students who have both financial need and academic merit. The goal is to make the Center affordable to students with the qualifications to contribute to and benefit from the academic programs in Nanjing. Scholarships covering differing levels of need are available to incoming students. No student will be turned away for financial reasons. In 2013-14,Â 100% of Center students who applied for aid received financial aid. This support was made possible due to generous donations from companies, foundations, and individuals such as: The Honorable Michael R. Bloomberg The Hassenfeld Family Foundation, in honor of Stephen D. Hassenfeld Stephen O. Lesser Michael W. and Christa G. Percopo The Starr Foundation Friends and family of former HNC faculty member James Townsend and his wife Sandy Perry Alumni of the HNC New Fellowships Beginning in Fall 2015! Thanks to the generosity of the HNC alumni and donor community, and in honor of the HNC's approaching 30th anniversary, starting in fall 2015 we will be able to guarantee a Future Leader Fellowship to each incoming MAIS student in the amount of $10,000, Â Future Leader Fellows will also be eligible for additional HNC fellowship funding over this guaranteed $10,000 based on need, merit, and availability. Â  In addition, other new HNC fellowship opportunties in 2015-2016 will include two full-tuition Dean's Fellowships : one for a MAIS student and one for a Certificate student. Â In order to be eligible for this award, applicants must demonstrate academic excellence, outstanding leadership ability, and service to their communities. To qualify for any HNC fellowships, applicants must submit the HNC Financial Aid Application by February 1. Â This short, two-page form can be found in the downloadable forms section of the online application. * Center fellowships are available to citizens of all countries except theÂ PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Federal Loans Federal direct loans are available to U.S. students who demonstrate need as calculated by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA may be completed online at www.fafsa.ed.gov . Paper copies of the application are typically available at your local library or university. Loans are handled through the Department of Education Direct Lending program in which loan money is dispersed directly to the university without banks or guaranteeing agencies. Loan amounts will show on the bill as a credit, and refunds will be mailed to you or deposited inÂ a bank account of your choice. Other Financial Aid Resources There are many organizations thatÂ can provide funding for your studies. We encourage you to look for additional funding. You should, however, begin applying forÂ  fellowships as soon as possibleÂ because many organizations require that you apply months in advance of attending graduate school.

Rangel International Affairs Program Â  Frequently Asked Questions We hope that the responses below will answer your questions. Please contact us via phone at 1-800-362-6546 or email atÂ  nanjing@jhu.edu Â with additional questions. Must I have three years of formal classroom Chinese in order to apply? Not necessarily. All applicants to the program must submit scores from the STAMP Chinese language proficiency exam in order to demonstrate their Chinese language ability.Â  Three or more years of Chinese usually results in an admissible score. Those with less classroom experience may apply, especially in the case of prolonged tenure in Asia or a family background involving Chinese. Admission into the master's degree program requires a higher level of Chinese proficiency than the Certificate program.Â  Click here Â for more information on the Chinese language proficiency examinations. Must I be in a graduate program to be eligible to attend the Center? No. Many students complete the Certificate program as a bridge between their undergraduate education and graduate school or between finishing their undergraduate degree and accepting a job in Asia. A number of students have already completed another graduate degree and/or have several years of work experience. The Master of Arts in International Studies (MAIS) degree offered in Nanjing is fully accredited by both The Johns Hopkins University and Nanjing University. Is the Center open to only Hopkins/SAIS students? No. The Center welcomes applications from qualified applicants worldwide. Each year, approximately 10% of the International students studying at the Center are non-U.S. citizens.Â  In the past, we haveÂ accepted students from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Holland, India, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and Zambia, among others. What does a "background in China studies" mean? "Background" refers to courses in Chinese history, political science, sociology, anthropology, economics, etc. It is not absolutely essential, but the majority of Center students have a background in these areas to draw upon.Â  There are no specific prerequisites for students attending the Center, thoughÂ M.A. candidatesÂ planning on pursuing a concentration in International Economics are expected to have taken at least introductory microeconomics and macroeconomics courses before enrolling. How do I arrange the Chinese proficiency test? In order to take the STAMP test, applicants must designate a proctor (ex:Â professor, T.A., departmental administrator, supervisor, etc.) who agrees to administer the exam.Â Applicants should then fillÂ outÂ theÂ  STAMP Test RequestÂ Form ,Â which must be signed by the designated proctor and returned to the Hopkins-Nanjing Center Washington Support Office.Â  The STAMP test should be taken before the application deadline. What is the most important part of the application? There is no single most important part. Chinese language proficiency serves as a fundamental indicator of whetherÂ a studentÂ will be able to handle the coursework in Nanjing, but each component of the application serves to provide the Admissions Committee with a more complete picture ofÂ eachÂ applicantÂ and helps themÂ decide whoÂ would beÂ suitable for study at the Center. Can I apply to both the Certificate and MAIS programs? Yes.Â Applicants wishing to apply to both the Certificate program and theÂ MAISÂ should indicate their intentions on the application form and be sure to submit all application materials required for both programs (i.e. M.A. concentration essay, GRE scores -Â required ofÂ MAIS applicants only, etc.). What are my chances of being accepted? Unfortunately, the answer to this question is too specifically-related to individual situationsÂ to beÂ posted effectivelyÂ here.Â ApplicantsÂ who are concerned about being admitted to the program shouldÂ call us at 1-800-362-6546 to discuss our admission requirements in detail. Can I write my essay in ChineseÂ or submit additional materials in Chinese? No,Â we can only accept application materials in English.Â TheÂ AdmissionsÂ CommitteeÂ isÂ a diverse group, comprisedÂ ofÂ Hopkins-Nanjing Center staff and alumni as well asÂ SAISÂ deansÂ andÂ faculty. In order to ensure that each application is thoroughly read by all members of the committee, we ask thatÂ applicants only submit materials in English. The committee will use individuals' Chinese language proficiency exam score and previous Chinese language courseworkÂ to assessÂ Chinese language ability. My transcripts are not in English. Will you accept them? No. Undergraduate transcripts not issued in English must be officially translated and sent to our office.Â Applicants whoÂ have completed additional coursework (i.e. at a Chinese university) may sendÂ unofficial translations of those transcripts. My recommendations are not in English. Will you accept them? No, we can only accept application materials in English.Â Â TheÂ AdmissionsÂ CommitteeÂ isÂ a diverse group comprisedÂ ofÂ Hopkins-Nanjing Center staff and alumni as well asÂ SAISÂ deansÂ andÂ faculty. In order to ensure that each application is thoroughly read by all members of the Committee, we ask thatÂ applicants only submit materials in English. We will, however, accept officially translated recommendations. Can letters of recommendation be faxed or emailed? The best way to submit recommendations is through our online application system.Â Applicants may register recommenders online and the application system will communicate with them directly to ensure secure delivery of the recommendation.Â IfÂ a recommender does not wish to use the online system,Â he or she mayÂ mail the recommendation to us in a sealed envelope or fax it to us directly at 202-663-7729. What is the Institution Code for my test scores? Applicants should have all test scores officially sent to the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington D.C.Â  The ETS code is 5610 .Â No department code is required. We are unable to receive scores sent to other divisions of Johns Hopkins University. Do I need to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)? Applicants planning to apply to the MAIS or HNC Certificate/SAIS MA mustÂ submit either GRE or GMAT scoresmÂ and are advisedÂ to take the examÂ  before Â our February 1 deadline. It takes approximately 3 weeks after testingÂ to receive scores.Â  Applicants for the Certificate program are not required to take the GRE. Do I need to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)? Non-native speakers of English are required to demonstrate English proficiency by submitting a recent TOEFL or IELTS score. However, applicants who have attendedÂ two or more yearsÂ at a university where the primary language of instruction is English doÂ NOT need to submit these scores. Do I need to submit transcripts for every college-level class I have taken? We require transcripts for all degree courses. For non-degree courses/programs, we strongly recommend - but do not require -Â thatÂ applicants submit a transcript, as well. What should I write in my statement of purpose? ApplicantsÂ should discuss whyÂ they wish to attend the Hopkins-Nanjing Center, and how this education will help facilitateÂ their ultimate career goals. This isÂ eachÂ prospective student'sÂ opportunity for the Admissions Committee to get to know him or her, so we suggest that applicantsÂ also tell us more about whoÂ they are and how selected past experiences have shapedÂ theirÂ goals and educational aspirations. What are the payment options for the application fee? The application fee may be paid through the online application with a credit card (Visa or Mastercard), or by mailing in a credit card authorization form, check or money order.Â  Please make checks or money orders out toÂ "Johns Hopkins University" and mail them to us at: Hopkins-Nanjing Center Office of International Admissions; 1740 Massachusetts Ave. NW; Washington, DC 20036. Is the application fee refundable or are fee waivers granted? The application fee is non-refundable. Fee waivers are granted in cases of financial need.Â Applicants wishing to request a fee waiver shouldÂ ask the financial aid office atÂ their college or university toÂ submit a letter requesting the waiver on their behalf. Where do I send application materials? Most of the application materials (recommendations, essays, application form and payment) can be submitted through our online application system. Additional materials should be mailed toÂ Hopkins-Nanjing Center Office of International Admissions; 1740 Massachusetts Ave. NW; Washington, DCÂ  20036 When do I need to take the STAMP? We ask that you take the STAMP Chinese language proficiency exam before the application deadline. We do not accept HSK scores. All applicants are required to take the STAMP test. How soon will I find out about my STAMP results after taking the test? How will I be notified? Applicants will be notified via email of their score within two business days of completing the STAMP test. What is the deadline to apply? For the HNC Certificate or MAIS programs, all application materialsÂ must be received by our officeÂ by Â February 1 .Â  The deadline for the HNC Certificate/SAIS MA isÂ  January 7 . Do you accept late applications? Late applications will be accepted on a case-by-case basis. Applicants wishing to apply late should contact the admissions office at 1-800-362-6546. When and how will I receive my admissions decision? Admissions decisions will be sent out via email and regular mail by late March.Â Applicants shouldÂ be sure to include a current mailing address onÂ the application form, and notify us if the listed email or mailing address changes after submitting the application. Does the Center offer a summer language program? No. The Center no longer hosts a summer Chinese language program. Students interested in taking a summer language program in China should apply directly to individual language programs.Â  Can I start my studies at the Center in the spring semester? No. Students in the Certificate program gain maximum benefit from the Center by attending for two semesters in a contiguous academic year. This allows students to develop important relationships with their fellow students and faculty, andÂ make the most of the Center's academic course offerings. MA students must also begin in the fall in order to complete a sequence required of all students in the program. How many hours are Center students in class each week? Certificate students take three to four courses a semester which each meet twice a week for an hour and a half. They are additionally encouraged to cross-register into courses in their non-target language and pursue independent studies. Master's students will take four courses per semester except for the last semester, during which the thesis will be the primary focus. Are there opportunities to work while I am at the Center? The residence permit issued to Hopkins-Nanjing Center students does not allowÂ students to work while they are in Nanjing. Center students have had internships during the month-long winter break and during the summer, but there are minimal opportunities for employment to pay for fees or living expenses.Â  A limited number of students may be awarded federal work-study funds, and will have the option of accepting work-study positions at the Center.Â  The majority of students, however, should not expect to find part-time work while enrolled in the program. Can my student loans be deferred while I am in Nanjing? Yes. The Washington Support Office can process loan deferment forms upon matriculation in Nanjing. Do I have to live at the Center? With a roommate? Unless accompanied by a spouse and/or dependent, all students are required to live at the Center. Students who will be accompanied by a spouse and/or dependents must arrange for off-campus housing.Â  Certificate students live in doubles with Chinese roommates. M.A. students have the option of requesting either singles or doubles.
