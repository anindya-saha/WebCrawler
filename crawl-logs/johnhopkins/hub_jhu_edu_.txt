A message from President Daniels | Video Weâ€™ve done big musical productions, a massive choreographed dance number, and a simple e-card, but weâ€™ve never done anything quite like this. This yearâ€™s installment of the presidentâ€™s annual â€œThank Youâ€? video features nearly 400 people (plus one Blue Jay) filmed at more than 80 distinct locations representing 10 divisionsâ€”all jam-packed into a one-minute, 20-second message of overwhelming gratitude. The year-end â€œThank Youâ€? video, a tradition that began in 2009, is President Ronald J. Danielsâ€™ way of saying thanks to everyone whose contributions (big and small) make what we do at Johns Hopkins possible.
