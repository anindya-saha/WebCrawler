Penn State | Office of the President Biography Video Photos News Comments Contact Office of the President SEARCH Eric J. Barron Welcome to Penn State It has been an exhilarating return to Penn State, an institution that was my professional home for 20 years. It's a great honor to be at the helm of an academic community I have always admired, and I thank the Penn State community for giving Molly and me such a warm welcome. It's very clear that people are the heart of this institution. Penn State faculty, students, staff and alumni have defined our success, and made Penn State a global leader in teaching, research and service. My first objective, as I begin my tenure as Penn State's 18th president, is to listen, assess and learn as much as I can about this institution and the people we serve. I consider it a personal obligation to ensure that we make a great institution even greater. I hope that if our paths cross you will introduce yourself. I share your deep commitment to Penn State, and look forward to working closely with the people who care so much about our University. Sincerely, Eric J.
