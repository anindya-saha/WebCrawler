Our commitment to need-blind admission and need-based financial aid ensures Cornellâ€™s financial aid programs are distributed equitably. The Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment is available to provide guidance, support and information for students and families interested in the financial aid process. Apply for Aid Applying for financial aid is separate process from the admissions application. This means you will submit your financial information before you are aware of your admissions decision. Applying for aid by the financial aid request dates will insure that your financial aid award is available when you receive your admissions decision. We want you to have all the information you need before making the choice to attend Cornell. Financial Aid Eligibility Cornell awards financial aid on the basis of demonstrated need . We do not offer scholarships based on academics, athletic ability, or any other talent. Once Cornell determines your financial need, we are committed to meeting that need with options that include various grants, loans, and student employment opportunities. We work hard to be consistent in the way we consider your financial circumstances from year to year. If your family's financial circumstances remain relatively unchanged throughout your time at Cornell, you can expect a predictable financial aid package each year. Costs to Attend The estimated costs to attend Cornell includes tuition, student fees, and allowances for housing, dining, books, supplies, and miscellaneous personal items. Financial Aid Calculator Our web-based Financial Aid Calculator may help provide you with your estimated eligibility for need-based financial aid from Cornell.
