This is her great aunt, Marjorie Thomsen, in about 1926, at age two. In the foreground are clusters of hens; in the background, a small house and rows of crops. The photo comes from her motherâ€™s side of the family, who farmed in Fresno, at one point owning their own farm and after the Great Depression as tenant farmers, and where Michelle, a fifth-generation from the area, was born and raised.Â  Fresno County is a dichotomy, says Jurkovich: it is the site simultaneously of one of the countryâ€™s highest rates of concentrated poverty, and of the highest level of agricultural production. While growing up there, Jurkovich observed a â€œstartling contrast of agricultural plenty side-by-side with hunger.â€? It was being raised around this dichotomy that fueled her fascination with hunger, which is the primary focus of her work. â€œIn that environment hunger is very clearly a political problem,â€? she says. â€œPeople are not hungry because thereâ€™s not enough food; the problem is people canâ€™t afford to buy it. And how you work to fix that, what you consider appropriate responses to this hunger, is deeply political."Â  Jurkovich earned her BA in English at Fresno State University, favoring the writings of Anne Bradstreet, Whitman, and Hawthorne.Â  After graduating in 2005, she accepted an internship in the US House of Representatives in Washington, DC through a program run by the Kenneth L. Maddy Institute, which takes â€œValley kidsâ€? (students from the San Joaquin Valley) and sends them to DC to learn about the inner workings of the government. She spent a summer on Capitol Hill before transitioning to an internship in the White House. The political environment of DC energized Jurkovich. Her internship in the White House started two weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit, and she left a month after then Chief of Staff to the Vice President, Scooter Libby, was indicted.Â  In the end, Jurkovich decided that while she was interested in politics, she didnâ€™t want to work that closely within the political machine. Instead, she returned to Fresno and applied to graduate school and decided to study hunger, â€œsomething I had been interested in and puzzled by for a very long time,â€? she says. Unfortunately, it wasnâ€™t until later that she realized, while pursuing her masterâ€™s degree in political science at California State University, Los Angeles, that political science didnâ€™t really spend much time talking about hunger.Â  â€œBut I had really good advisers,â€? Jurkovich recalls, â€œwho helped bring an important conversation [hunger and food security] into this discipline, which is usually more interested in war and weapons.â€? â€œHunger is not very sexy, but itâ€™s a huge issue,â€? she says, noting that more people die of hunger-related causes than all wars, civil and international, combined.Â  At George Washington University, where Jurkovich earned her PhD, she was reunited with DC, the city that had originally introduced her to politics.Â  While in graduate school, she met her adviser and mentor Martha Finnemore. Her dissertation, which explores blame diffusion in international hunger campaigns, surveyed senior executive staff and international anti-hunger campaigns like OxFam, World Vision, Bread for the World, and Amnesty, as well as foundations such as Gates and Rockefeller.Â  In the survey, she asked respondents: what causes hunger, whoâ€™s to blame and how does one solve it? Jurkovich was surprised to find that each member of these organizations had different answers.Â  Not having a clear â€œprescriptive normâ€? disallows common centralized advocacy campaigns on a specific target, making the issue of hunger uniquely problematic and hard to solve. Â  "IfÂ there isn't an underlying norm in the issue area of hunger, itâ€™s much more challenging to link a particular behavior to one actor," she explains. Jurkovichâ€™s thesis presents â€œan alternative model of advocacyâ€?â€”the â€œBuckshot modelâ€? â€”to explain blame diffusion in hunger. The model involves scattering international advocacy campaigns across multiple targets.Â  For her next project, Jurkovich is excited to take advantage of Watsonâ€™s interdisciplinary environment to compare hunger and education. â€œWatson is exceptional,â€? she says, sitting in her sun-filled third-floor office. â€œIt's a place where they don't want you to hide the fact that you're interested in policy-relevant stuffâ€”in fact, they encourage it. They want your work to be rigorous and to be able to bridge conversations in academia and the broader policy world. â€œMy dissertation was all about food, and what Iâ€™m trying to do now is see how can we use comparative cases to sharpen and hone. I think we learn a lot from comparisonâ€¦ There's a tendency to think things are inevitable, that the world looks the way it does right now because it had to â€¦. The way you challenge this as a political scientist is to find issue areas that are equally hard and expensive [and that have] gone a different way.â€?Â  Jurkovich looks at the photo of the young girl on the wall. â€œI think in trying to understand big problems, like hunger, it's essential to be mindful of perspectiveâ€”and I mean this in a few different ways.Â  The first is understanding that all problems worth studying are complex, and it's important to be able to look at them from different angles, with different lenses.Â In part, this means turning issue areas over in our minds and trying to come at them from different angles, to see what new things we learn.Â It also means being aware of the limitations of our own disciplinary training in conditioning us to ask only certain questions or to look at problems in only certain ways. â€œI gain new perspective from taking my research outside of my academic peer group and discussing it with, for instance, people working in the policy world, friends back in Fresno, or my students during lecture. I'm always challenged by my communities outside my academic peer groupâ€”both in terms of more clearly articulating what I'm saying but also in challenging my perspective.Â What am I missing by looking at the problem the way I am?Â  Is what I'm doing interesting to broader audiences?Â  Have I become too insular in my thinking? Will I be able to contribute something meaningful at the end of this project?Â  These are things I am forced to think about when I broaden my community and open myself up to looking at important issues with different lenses.â€?Â  â€“ Jaime Lowe Â  Â  Share Contact Jobs WATSON INSTITUTE 111 Thayer Street Brown University, Box 1970 Providence, RI USA 02912-1970 P +1 401 863 2809 watson_institute@brown.edu 2014 Watson Institute for International Studies
