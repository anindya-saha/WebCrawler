On Sundays sheâ€™d sit at home, patiently poring over math problems arranged by her mother. Upon completion, Bahar reaped a sweet reward: a plate of her favorite snacksâ€”cherries, bananas and apples. â€œWe called them 'fruit puzzles,'â€? she says with a smile. Baharâ€™s enthusiasm for math never waned and she went on to earn both a bachelorâ€™s and a masterâ€™s in statistics: â€œItâ€™s always made sense to me, to be able to explain things with numbers.â€? However, a year into her masterâ€™s program at the University of Tennessee, she began to feel constrained. Working with numbers and interpreting data still inspired her, but she wanted more. â€œI realized I wanted to do something more applied, rather than being buried in the methodology," she says. "And the business world seemed resistant when it came to innovations in statistical tools.â€? Her masterâ€™s thesisâ€”analyzing classification methods of cancerous tissue from mammogram data changed everything. That work opened her eyes to a world in which statistics could help others:Â  From there, Bahar applied to Brown to deepen her investigative skills and continue her pursuit of research aimed at improving health care. Currently, for her dissertation, Bahar is analyzing genetic data from a clinical trial conducted on individuals with type-2 diabetes. The idea is to better understand how patients respond to different treatment methods based on their genetic makeup. The outcome, Bahar hopes, will help enhance a doctor's ability to make personalized treatment recommendations. Thanks to the Universityâ€™s robust graduate support, sheâ€™ll finish her studies at the School of Public Health debt-free: â€œWhen I got the admissions offer, I didnâ€™t even wait for other schools. The interaction between faculty and students is really wonderful here. It makes me feel at home.â€?
